CSCE 606 Software Engineering Group Project


Summary

Project aims to develop an online website for the Department of Animal Science at Texas A&M University. The website will give a brief idea about the Department on its Home page. It will also include a Peopleâ€™s page. The page will enlist all the people and students involved in the research under the department. It will also have a Contact Us page to reach out to the department. The website serves the students enrolled in the department and also to other academic scholars interested in the animal sciences.

In addition to these the project has three major purposes. First, it shares the projects done by previous students under Professor Courtney Daigle. The website will enlist the courses and projects. They will be sorted by year with links to the overall description and contributors to the project. Future students can use these projects as reference for building their own projects. The page will also provide an option to add projects which will be approved by Admin. 

Second, the website enlists all the relevant publications in the Animal Sciences area published in top journals. It aims to serve as a hub for the research in Animal Sciences. Projects and publications accessible through the site will help students prepare for competitions in this domain. The page will also provide an option to add publications to this page on approval by Admin.

Finally, the website should serve as a resource for Ethograms. Ethograms are behaviors exhibited by different species for basic tasks such as drinking, eating. For all the species, each entry associated with an Ethogram will be enlisted along with its respective video and a general description. On clicking the link to the video, the video will pop up exhibiting the exact behavior shown by species. Description along with videos will help in understanding the general behavior exhibited by the species and easy identification of species. Page allows additions to the content through approval from the Admin.
